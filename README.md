Fully functional interactive blackjack game in Processing.

Functionality:
1. When the round first starts, the user is in a game that was automatically started.
2. To start the round, the user must select a bet amount with the slider and then press the button “Place Bet” to place the bet. Once this happens cards will be dealt to both the dealer 3. and the player.
3. When the player and dealer have their hands, the player repeatedly chooses to hit or stand based on their hand value.
4. Once the player is done with their turn, the dealer automatically carries out their actions.
5. When the hand is over, the winner is evaluated and receives the content of the pot.
6. The user can then press “New Round” to create a new round or “New Game” to reset their balance to 500 and start the game anew.
